#### A C-sharp program: part one

## Description

This is the first stage in a two-stage project to create a "word counter" program, as the first independent project for the first two weeks of the Epicodus C# curriculum. 

The program will prompt the user for a word AND, separately, a sentence. It will then check to see how often the initial word appears in the sentence. This only applies to words *in their entirety,* so letters of a word embedded in other words (e.g., if the user's word is "car," "carpet" will not be counted).

The initial (current, as of 4/26/19) phase will invovle creating tests and building out logic. The next phase will invovle creating the user interface.

### Specs 

Initial tests will confirm that given word, in its integrality (i.e., not a within a longer word), in a phrase. The first test will be designed to "successfully fail" by submitting a test argument that is a word NOT appearing in the test string.
